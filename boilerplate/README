These scripts should be in the PATH and help with very frequent tasks
in gcc development, such as configuring gcc, extracting and comparing
testsuite results etc.

They more-or-less assume the following directory layout.  There is a
top-level gcc directory, usually but not necessarily ~/gcc, which
contains sub-directories with common structure.  Directory src with
checkout sources, obj for building, (optionally) b-obj for
bootstrapping, inst as destination for make install and logs for .sum
files with testing results.

So for example in my ~/gcc there is ~/gcc/trunk for pristine untouched
trunk, and ~/gcc/icln for IPA work, among others.  Both have
subdirectories mentioned above.  The only special one among them is
~/trunk/logs which is supposed to hold the untouched trunk testsuite
results to compare against.
